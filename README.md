    this is a simple desktop app for downloading videos from youtube!
    once the button is pressed,
    the code here will create a new directory in the folder you are in named:
    'yt_videos', and download the video you asked for in mp4!
    this simple app was created by amit ginat (me) and is using:
    
    * tkinter library for the gui
    * pytube library for the Youtube downloading
